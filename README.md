# Newliner

##### Version: 1.0

A simple plugin for Coda 2 to ensure that every file has a newline at the end

So far, it has only been tested on OS X 10.9 with Xcode 5.x.  If you have any trouble, feel free to open an issue/pull request.

## Install

```
$ ./install.sh
```

## Notes

If you want to build it from Xcode, just open the project and select `Run`.

The plugin will automatically be installed to the Coda 2 Plug-ins directory.

## TODO

- Allow selection of file extensions to which this plugin should apply
- Account for non-standard line endings
